## Description
This application was made using MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Mongoose, and Express.js. It is a database for a social media platform 

The user can use the database to add new users with a valid email and username, join other users as friends, and post "thoughts" and "reactions" (similar to comments and replies you see in social media). Users can also update and delete thoughts and reactions as well as remove friends. Try it out by creating your own username and start interacting with friends!

## Installation
To run this code, simply clone the code, open the cloned code in your favorite IDE, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then run `npm start` to start the server.
